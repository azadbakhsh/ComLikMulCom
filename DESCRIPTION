Title: Multiple comparisons using composite likelihood
Version: 0.1
Authors: Mahdis Azadbakhsh, Xin Gao, Hanna Jankowski
Description: Multiple hypothesis testing \eqn{H_0 :C\beta = 0}, based on composite likelihood inference for 
clustered data, with common covariance structure across the clusters. The critical value is based on multivariate 
normal quantile, using the R-package \code{multcomp} by Hothorn, et.al.
Depends:  R (>= 3.2.2)
